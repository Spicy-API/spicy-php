/**
 * Official SpicyAPI client for PHP 8.1+.
 *
 * SpicyAPI serves image and video generation models behind one API. This package
 * covers the asynchronous media workflow end to end: discover a model and its
 * input schema, upload local reference material, quote a request, submit it,
 * wait for a terminal state, and collect the result.
 *
 * Text models are deliberately out of scope: they speak the OpenAI, Anthropic
 * and Gemini wire formats, so the established PHP clients for those already work
 * against this service.
 *
 * It depends on no library: ext-json, ext-hash and either ext-curl or the
 * `https://` stream wrapper, all of which ship with a default PHP build.
 *
 * Everything here follows the published OpenAPI contract at
 * https://docs.spicyapi.ai/openapi.yaml. Field names, error codes and limits are
 * quoted from it in the comments so a reader can check them against the source
 * instead of trusting this file.
 *
 * Scope: SpicyAPI is mostly image and video generation, which is asynchronous —
 * create a task, then poll or receive a webhook. That is what this client wraps.
 * Text models speak OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini on `/v1` and `/v1beta`; for
 * those, point an official SDK at `https://api.spicyapi.ai/v1` and change
 * nothing else. There is no reason to wrap them here.
 *
 * Usage (every optional argument is a named argument):
 *
 *   require_once __DIR__ . '/SpicyClient.php';
 *   use SpicyApi\SpicyClient;
 *
 *   $client = new SpicyClient();                       // reads SPICY_API_KEY
 *   $file   = $client->uploadFile('/tmp/reference.png');
 *   $task   = $client->createTask(
 *       model: 'MODEL_ID_FROM_CATALOG',
 *       input: ['prompt' => 'a paper-cut city at dusk', 'image_url' => $file['uri']],
 *       idempotencyKey: SpicyClient::idempotencyKey(),
 *   );
 *   $done = $client->waitForTerminal($task['taskId']);
 *
 * PSR-4 note: one file holds the client, its enums and its exceptions so that
 * copying a single file is enough. In a real project, split it per class.
 *
 * @license The same terms as the repository this file ships in.

     * Two behaviours worth knowing:
     *
     *  - a `succeeded` task whose assets are still `pending` keeps being polled.
     *    Returning it would hand the caller a result with no usable URL.
     *  - the timeout throws {@see SpicyTimeoutError}, which does **not** mean

     *    Persist the task ID and reconcile later, or use a webhook.
     *
     * `$timeoutSeconds` is the budget for the whole wait, and each poll is held
     * inside what is left of it. Two rules follow, and both matter:
     *
     *  - **one poll timing out is not this wait failing.** While budget remains,
     *    polling continues. A single slow response must not end a ten-minute
     *    wait on a task that is still running and still being billed.
     *  - **the exception thrown when the budget really does run out carries the
     *    task ID.** That identifier is the only way to reconcile the task
     *    afterwards, so it must not be lost to a lower layer's timeout.
     *
     * A budget under {@see self::MIN_POLL_BUDGET_SECONDS} therefore throws
     * without polling at all: a request given a near-zero deadline only
     * produces a timeout from the request layer, which does not know the task
     * ID. Use `getTask()` directly for a one-shot look at a task.
     *
     * For anything longer than a request-response cycle, prefer `callBackUrl`
     * plus {@see SpicyWebhook}: a PHP-FPM worker blocked on a video for four
     * minutes is a worker that is not serving traffic.

 * the digest is lower-case hex and the result is Base64. `taskId` comes from
 * top-level `task_id` for payload v1 and from `data.taskId` for v2.
 *
 * Three ways PHP code gets this wrong, all of which are silent until someone
 * looks for them:
 *
 *  1. **Re-serializing the body.** The digest covers the bytes that arrived.
 *     `json_encode(json_decode($body))` reorders nothing but changes spacing,
 *     escaping and float formatting, and the signature stops matching — or, if
 *     a framework already parsed the body, the raw bytes are gone entirely.
 *     Read `php://input`, keep the string, and hand that exact string here.
 *  2. **Comparing with `==` or `===`.** String comparison short-circuits on the
 *     first differing byte, which leaks the signature one byte at a time to
 *     anyone who can time the endpoint. `==` is worse still: PHP compares two
 *     numeric strings numerically, so a Base64 value shaped like `0e123` can
 *     equal a different one. {@see hash_equals} is the only correct tool here.
 *  3. **Skipping the timestamp.** A valid signature stays valid forever. Without
 *     a freshness window, a delivery captured once can be replayed for good.
 *
 * Deliveries are retried, so the handler must be idempotent regardless: in v2,
 * `request_id` is the stable delivery ID to deduplicate on.
 *
 * This class verifies the scheme used by the per-task `callBackUrl`:
 * `base64(HMAC-SHA256(secret, "taskId.timestamp.hex(sha256(body))"))`. Saying
 * which scheme matters because a second, account-level delivery scheme is
 * planned; when that ships it gets its own verifier rather than extra arguments
 * here, so code written against this class keeps working unchanged.
